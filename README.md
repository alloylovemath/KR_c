# The C Programming Language, Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie

Well, I was reading the famous book *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan &
Ritchie for learing C. But I found that there are some revises needs to be down.
The book (2ed edition) was published several years ago, and there are a lot
of changes in C. So, I start this repository, try to re-write some of the codes
from the book.

If you find errors in this repository, feel free to point out since I'm not such
a geek in programming, not yet. Anyway, hope this repository can help you.
